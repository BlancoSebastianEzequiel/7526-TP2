Exercise 1

a) Run Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine distribution of time between client arrivals
    Exponential distribution with scale of 180 seconds accepted
    Exponential distribution with scale of 240 seconds discarded
b) Simulate 1000 days of new ATM
c) Graph banknotes in ATM in the first day
d) Mean wait + usage time: 15.2 minutes
e) Compare to current ATM (current failure rate: 20%)
    ATM should be changed since new failure rate is 5.8%
